The OpenPERT Microsoft Excel add-in was created to bring the betaPert distribution to practitioners of numerous professions and disciplines that leverage subject matter expert opinion, without the additional expense of commercial statistical function / simulation add-ins.

**Version 1.0 of the OpenPERT Add-In was released on August 9th, 2011 in conjunction with the Metricon 6.0 conference. See the downloads page to download the various files included with this release**

Here are a couple of videos on OpenPERT.
